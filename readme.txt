tWPtter micro-blogging plugin that allows the addition of a micro-post carrying widget or page to your blog. 

== Description ==
**tWPtter** (pronounced t-WHIP-ter) is a micro-blogging plugin for Wordpress.

**'twps'** ~ tWPtter allows you to publish short posts (known as twps, text snippets, facts and blurts on a widget or page within your blog. tWPtter twps (micro-posts) can be upto 150 characters long and optionally contain a link to a website, article or blog post.

tWPtter supports Wordpress tags by allowing you to associate a single tag with a twp. This will then provide a link to all posts within your blog that carry the same tag.

To make micro-blogging even easier, you can post to tWPtter on the move and when away from your computer via any email enabled device.

A number of options are given:
